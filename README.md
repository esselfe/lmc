# lmc
This bash script is for installing a graphical environment installation using Lunar-Linux  
precompiled install cache archives (generates an unconfigured setup, for now) [64bit only].  

Note that this program is currently in alpha stage and has not been extensivly tested.  
You need a running Lunar-Linux installation to install the files. You can get an  
installation iso image @ http://download.lunar-linux.org/lunar/testing/daily/ or  
http://lunar.lart.ca/ or https://hobby.esselfe.ca/iso/  

The cache archives used are currently hosted and generated by my personal Lunar system.  

Also note that you have to configure the new environment and this can require a certain  
amount of knowledge to perform, only installed files are copied, the modules come with  
their default configuration.
